How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows changes in files you're using and helps to find typo mistakes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps me to easily find mistakes in code, or to restore more likeble
	version of file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Because you choose to save part of your logical work, it's more likeble
	to use Git. It's actually  good to automatically save changes, but
	these might be not useful changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    These systems are using for different purpose. In git it's vital
	to save all files because changing of one file leads to changing
	 another. It's easier to look through the changes in definite
	time, than search for all changes in all files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log helps us to see all the commits we made during the developing.
	Diff gives us difference between two different commits: how many 
	lines we've added and removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always return to past version, i can overide mistakes,
	which i can't find, and i'm not afraid to broke all of my code
	and search for mistake so long.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try develop some Django project using Vitaly Podoba tutorials.
	When I'll done with this course, I will do that.
